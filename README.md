The **Stock Market Predictor** project aims to develop a web scraping application that collects real-time stock data from various financial websites and analyzes trends to predict future stock performance. The primary goal is to create an intuitive tool for investors to gain insights into stock price movements based on historical and current data. The app utilizes Python for web scraping with libraries such as **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium**, while **Pandas** is employed for data manipulation and analysis. Future iterations of the project may incorporate **machine learning models** like **scikit-learn** for more advanced predictive analytics.

**Key Objectives**:
- Gather real-time stock data from multiple sources.
- Process and analyze data to predict potential stock price trends.
- Build an intuitive interface for easy interpretation of predictions.
- Potentially integrate machine learning models for enhanced prediction accuracy.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- Pandas for data analysis
- Potential future use of scikit-learn for machine learning predictions
